# PopularMovies

Most of us can relate to kicking back on the couch and enjoying a movie with friends and family. 
In this project, you’ll build an app to allow users to discover the most popular movies playing. 

App will:

Present the user with a grid arrangement of movie posters upon launch.
Allow your user to change sort order via a setting:
The sort order can be by most popular or by highest-rated
Allow the user to tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional information such as:
original title
movie poster image thumbnail
A plot synopsis (called overview in the api)
user rating (called vote_average in the api)
release date

To Run this code:

First you need to generate the API key, Steps are given below:

-To fetch popular movies, you will use the API from themoviedb.org.
-If you don’t already have an account, you will need to create one in order to request an API Key.
-In your request for a key, state that your usage will be for educational/non-commercial use. 
-You will also need to provide some personal information to complete the request. 
-Once you submit your request, you should receive your key via email shortly after.
-In order to request popular movies you will want to request data from the /movie/popular and /movie/top_rated endpoints. 
-An API Key is required.
-Once you obtain your key, you assign it to "API_KEY" variable in MainActivity.java class.


Then run the code..!! 
          
            Happy Coding :)
